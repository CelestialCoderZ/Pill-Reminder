# Pill-Reminder
A compact smart pill reminder using ESP32, DS3231 RTC, LEDs, buzzer, button, and servo. It alerts users at preset times with sound and light, opens the pill tray automatically, and confirms intake through a button press. If not acknowledged, it marks the dose as missed—ensuring reliable medication tracking.
